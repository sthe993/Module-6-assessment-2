                       <p>Frozen is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated adventure musical fantasy comedy-drama film, created and produced at Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, The Snow Queen, it is the 53rd animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon.</p>
					   <p>The story centers fearless optimist but also naive Princess Anna, who embarks on a perilous journey to save her kingdom from a curse conjured by her older sister, Queen Elsa. Along the way, she partners up with a misanthropic mountain man, his trusty reindeer, and an enchanted snowman with dreams of experiencing summer. All the while, Anna's supposedly "dashing" fianc√©, Prince Hans, has his own plans for the queen and her kingdom.</p>

                       <h3>SING MOVIE</h3>
                       <p>Sing is a 2016 American computer-animated musical comedy film[4] produced by Illumination Entertainment and released by Universal Pictures. It is the first film of the franchise of the same name. The film was written and directed by Garth Jennings, co-directed by Christophe Lourdelet[1] and stars the ensemble voices of Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlett Johansson, John C. Reilly, Tori Kelly, Taron Egerton, and Nick Kroll. Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the film centers on Buster Moon, a struggling theater owner who holds a singing competition to save his theatre, as well as how the competition interferes with the personal lives of its contestants.</p>
					   <p>In a city of anthropomorphic animals called Calatonia, Buster Moon owns a struggling theater, and is threatened with foreclosure by bank representative Judith. He decides to hold a singing competition with a prize of $1,000, but a typo made by his assistant Miss Crawly adds two extra zeros to the prize money. The misprinted flyers are blown out of the window by a fan before they can be proofread, and float across the city.

Crowds of animals gather to audition, and Buster selects his contestants. These include housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; punk-rock Ash; teenager Johnny, son of mobster Big Daddy; street musician Mike; a trio of dancing frogs; and opera singer camel Pete. Teenager Meena fails her audition from stage fright, Ash's self-absorbed boyfriend Lance is dismissed from the contest, and Rosita is paired with an exuberant pig named Gunter for a dance routine. After Buster discovers the flyers advertise a prize of $100,000, he joins his friend Eddie on a visit with Eddie's wealthy grandmother, former singing star Nana Noodleman. Nana is reluctant to sponsor the prize money, but agrees to attend a private preview of the show before making a decision.</p>
